Description: MP3/Ogg Vorbis broadcast streaming library (development)
 A library for communicating with and sending data to Icecast and Icecast 2
 streaming audio servers.  It handles the socket connection, the timing of
 the data transmission, and prevents bad data from getting to the server.
 .
 With just a few lines of code, a programmer can easily turn any application
 into a streaming source for an Icecast-based server.  Libshout also allows
 developers who want a specific feature set (database access, request taking)
 to concentrate on that feature set, instead of worrying about how server
 communication works.
 .
 This package contains the development headers, static libraries, and source
 code to an example program.
